                Dont't let failures put a setback on you.
                There is nothing as strong as these simple words 'TRUST THE PROCESS'.

                <br />
                So Soldier keep your chin up and your defence ready and your punching hand closed in,
                 for when the time comes 'PUNCH - PUNCH - DUCK - SAVE'.<span> Roll With The Punches</span>
